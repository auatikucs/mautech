        Although the University has been in existence since 1981, and its dream to 
        have a College of Medical Sciences has been on for some time to enable it improve 
        access to medical education to her catchment area and beyond, the zeal and efforts 
        put in place by the University and the host community in the last 3 years or so has been most 
        remarkable.
        This culminated in the University Governing council in 2018 setting-up a committee of 
        respected members of the University and the Federal Medical centre Yola under the able 
        leadership of the then Deputy Vice Chancellor (Administrative matters) Professor Shehu A. 
        Iya to carry out a feasibility study and advise the Council appropriately. The other members
         of the committee were Professor Abubakar Awwal Mohammed (Medical Director, FMC Yola), the 
         current Deputy Vice- Chancellor Administration Prof. M. Inuwa Jaafaru, Prof (Director academic
             Planning).
